# Epigenetic-Design-Automation
Ethan Dale McCoy's BioE134 Final Project

- Gathers and processes GEO data to find genes with hyper/hypo methylation within a target sample
- Creates dCas9 constructs for the target sample to adjust its methylation towards a control epigenetic profile
- Testing these constructs is meant to be automated with the Opentrons Python Protocol API but I didn't get that far

EpigeneticDesignAutomation.py is the main module 

cli.py is a command line interface to play around with 

tests.py contains some tests on GEO DataSets of psoriasis lesions and cocaine addicted brains
